# Basic_Python_Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic Python projects I created as part of my learning journey.

## Projects Included:

* **Guess the Number:** A simple game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
* **Rock Paper Scissors:** A classic two-player game against the computer.
* **Text Adventure:** A basic interactive story where the user makes choices.
* **Calculator:** A command-line calculator with basic arithmetic operations (and some enhancements!).
* **Unit Converter:** A tool to convert between different units of measurement (temperature, length, etc.).
* **To-Do List:** A command-line application to manage tasks, with features like saving, marking complete, and editing.
* **Password Generator:** A script to generate random passwords with customizable options.
* **Contact Book:** A basic application to store and manage contacts.

These projects helped me practice fundamental Python concepts such as input/output, control flow, data structures, functions, and working with modules.
